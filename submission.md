Papers can be submitted via [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=thecvf.com/CVPR/2024/Workshop/DCAMI). The submission should be anonymous and follow the CVPR conference [format](https://cvpr.thecvf.com/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuidelines) and [template](https://github.com/cvpr-org/author-kit/releases). We encourage submissions of **3-8 pages (max. 8)** excl. references. Supplementary material can be submitted as well.

A double-blind reviewing process is adhered to guarantee paper quality. There will be a single round of reviews without a rebuttal. In submitting a paper, authors implicitly acknowledge that no paper of substantially similar content has been or will be submitted to another conference or workshop until the decisions have been made by our workshop.
