Papers can be submitted via [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=thecvf.com/CVPR/2024/Workshop/DCAMI) until **March 31, 2024**. The submission should be anonymous and follow the CVPR conference [format](https://cvpr.thecvf.com/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuidelines) and [template](https://github.com/cvpr-org/author-kit/releases). We encourage submissions of **4-8 pages** excl. references. Supplementary material can be submitted as well.

A double-blind reviewing process is adhered to guarantee paper quality. There will be a single round of reviews without a rebuttal. Decisions on acceptance will be announced by **April 28, 2024**. In submitting a paper, authors implicitly acknowledge that no paper of substantially similar content has been or will be submitted to another conference or workshop until the decisions have been made by our workshop.

The workshop is **non-archival**, i.e. accepted papers will not appear in the conference proceedings.
