    <h2>Jihun Yoon</h2>
</p>
<p>
    Jihun Yoon is an AI research engineer at Hutom in Seoul, South Korea. His main focus is on developing techniques for surgical scene understanding that enable a quantitative evaluation of surgeries. One of his main research objectives is to improve model generalization through understanding datasets. Jihun and his team at Hutom have recently published the SISVSE dataset at MICCAI 2022, which is currently the largest robotic gastrectomy segmentation dataset and makes use of virtual surgery synthetic data. Jihun was also awarded for winning the object detection in video challenge at EPICKitchens Challenges, CVPR 2020, with a novel semi-supervised learning method for sparsely annotated datasets.
