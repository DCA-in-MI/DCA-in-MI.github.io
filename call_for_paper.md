## Call for Papers

We invite submissions on papers related to Data Curation and Augmentation in Medical Imaging (see [Scope](#scope)). All accepted papers will be presented in the poster session during the workshop. Selected papers will be given the opportunity of an oral presentation.

Papers should be submitted to one of three tracks:

- **Track 1: Archival**:
  - Original research papers that have not been published previously at any other peer-reviewed venue. Accepted papers will be published in the CVPRW proceedings.
  - Track-1 submissions must be anonymous and papers will be reviewed in accordance with the **double-blind** reviewing policy. Submitted papers must be 3-8 pages in the [CVPR format](https://cvpr.thecvf.com/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuidelines) excluding references. Additional supplementary material can be submitted as well.
  - Submission link: [Track 1](https://openreview.net/group?id=thecvf.com/CVPR/2024/Workshop/DCAMI_archival)

- **Track 2: Non-Archival, Unpublished Work**:
  - Original research that have not been published previously at any other peer-reviewed venue. Accepted papers will be presented at the workshop but will not be included in the CVPRW proceedings. This is intended for work-in-progress, preliminary results, or other research that is best suited for a workshop setting.
  - Track-2 submissions must be anonymous and papers will be reviewed in accordance with the **double-blind** reviewing policy. Submitted papers must be 3-8 pages in the [CVPR format](https://cvpr.thecvf.com/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuidelines) excluding references. Additional supplementary material can be submitted as well.
  - Submission link: [Track 2](https://openreview.net/group?id=thecvf.com/CVPR/2024/Workshop/DCAMI)

- **Track 3: Non-Archival, Published Work**:
  - Papers that have been published or accepted previously at another peer-reviewed venue. Accepted papers will be presented at the workshop but will not be included in the CVPRW proceedings. This is intended for work that has been published or accepted recently and is of interest to the workshop audience.
  - Track-3 papers can be submitted as-is, and will only be reviewed for relevance to the workshop.
